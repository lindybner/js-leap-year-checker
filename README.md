# JavaScript Leap Year Checker

A simple JavaScript exercise to determine whether a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.

## How It Works

The program uses the following logic to check if a year is a leap year:

1. If the year is divisible by 4, it could be a leap year.
2. If the year is divisible by 100, it must also be divisible by 400 to be a leap year.

The JavaScript function `isLeapYear` implements this logic in a concise way.
